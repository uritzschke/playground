PLAYGROUND TO LEARN TECHNOLOGIES

This is a simple personal playground for myself to learn Eclipse RCP. It follows the description and example of the book "Eclipse Rich Client Platform, 2nd Edition" by Jeff McAffer, Jean-Michel Lemieux and Chris Aniszczyk.

There is also a GitHUB project which includes the completed project: https://github.com/eclipsesource/es-trainings-hyperbola
